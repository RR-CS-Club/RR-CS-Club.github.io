This is the official website for the Ronald Reagan Computer Science Club (Est. 2021). Take a look at the website [Here](https://rr.hackclub.com/)!

## The Club
We are a club located at Ronald Reagan High School, San Antonio and are dedicated to provide members resources to code and make amazing projects that will benefit the commuinity. In essence, we want to introduce Computer Science to beginners and expand the horizons of those with some previous knowledge so that they can build their dream. We strongly believe that Computer Science is a creative endeavor that benefits the entire world in many ways, and this was only amplified during the Coronaivrus pandemic.

## Motivation
This website was built in order to host all the necessary information for members at the Reagan Computer Science Club and provide a clear way to apply and contact the club. The idea behind the design and color schemes also follows a principle to keep it easy to use and simple to understand.

As we continue to build out this website, we are increasingly motivated by our members and their needs as well as their feedback. The website is continusously trying to improve as we attempt to create a complete resource for members to use.

## Features
Currently, the only functioning page in the website is the home page, which includes links for the application and contact form. This page is a simple landing page esigned for ease of use to provide members and visitors with a comprehensive look at what the club and website are about. This website was built from scratch using React and designed with Figma, which allows us to have a lot more control over the functionality of the website.

## Next Steps
Currently, we want to add four additional pages to the website with various features.
1. The Wall Of Fame page will show off member projects for every workshop, as well as any side projects they have built.
2. The Team Page will include the bios of all current officers and team members that run the club.
3. The events page will include dates, times and resources for various events.
4. The Workshops page will contain all workshops that have been used at the club, as well as some resources.

We also need a way to easily add new workshops, events, projects, and team members for their respective pages.

## Contributing
Constributions are always welcome! Help us achieve our goals outlined in next steps by opening issues, pushing code, or adding to discussion in issues and PRs. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
